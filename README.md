# K1LL3RBTCH Webshell

Hi, Welcome to my first project on my Github page. i wrote a Webshell in PHP and i thought<br>
it would be nice to make a Repository and upload it to my Github. I think programming/coding<br>
is about creativity and to feel free to make anything you want.

`K1LL3RBTCH has the following funtions:`

- Login system (Not encrypted.)
- Displays security information
- Has a tiny filemanager
- Web terminal
- Defacing attack
- selfkilling (self deleting)

`And it is tested on:`
- Windows 11
- Linux Ubuntu
- Debian 11 (Bullseye)
- Apache2

<b>Reminder</b>: The webshell automatically adapts to the operating system.

# How to install
On a linux based webserver sometimes you don't have the permissions<br>
for writing, executing and more etc. Make sure when you attack a web-<br>
server K1LL3RBTCH needs the right permissions like 777. For testing<br>
this webshell on your server make sure it has the following permissions:<br><br>

code(example):
```
#: sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html
```
<br>

When thats done, if you want you can set your own password to change the<br>
configation file and edit the `$p4ss_k3y` variable to your own password.

<h1>Support</h1>

This project will continue and many more things will be added.<br>
if you've found any bugs or if you have any idea's, let me know, would appreciate it! :)
